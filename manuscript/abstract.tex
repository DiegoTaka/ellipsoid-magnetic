In this work, we present results from a numerical
modeling of the magnetic field and total field anomaly,
represented by triaxial, prolate and oblate ellipsoid sources.
The synthetic data is generated by means of a Python code to obtain
the three components of the magnetic field and the approximate total-field
anomaly for n-souces.
Numerical tests allowed us to compare the results with other implementation 
(e.g. spheres) and to provide analytical results for anisotropy of magnetic
susceptibility as well as for self-demagnetization effects,
which can be easily adapted for distinctive geologic
structures - hence being an useful tool for educational
(e.g., potential methods and rock magnetism) and applied
geophysics (e.g., characterization of high magnetic
susceptibility, mineralized bodies) purposes.
This code will be freely available to the scientific
community through the \textit{Fatiando a Terra} software.
